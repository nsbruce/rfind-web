## Getting started

For local development you need a [SciChart license](https://www.scichart.com/).

Run `yarn` to install necessary node_modules.

Run `yarn make:envfile` to build the necessary .env files.

Run `yarn start app` in one console to start the React front end and `yarn start api` in another to start the nodejs back end.

## Deploying
